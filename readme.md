🪙 Currency Exchange System – We are B.Tech 3rd-semester students who developed a simple and efficient Currency Exchange System as part of our college project. Our goal was to create a user-friendly tool . This project uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for a clean interface. Users can convert currencies, view past conversions.
# 🌍 Real-Time Currency Exchange System

A simple and responsive **real-time currency converter** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The system fetches live exchange rates from an online API and updates values dynamically.
It provides an intuitive interface for converting between multiple global currencies.

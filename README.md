🪙 Currency Exchange System – We are B.Tech 3rd-semester students who developed a simple and efficient Currency Exchange System as part of our college project. Our goal was to create a user-friendly tool . This project uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for a clean interface. Users can convert currencies, view past conversions.
